The libraries we will be required are : 
1. Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format.
2. Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations.
3. Matplotlib / Seaborn – This library is used to draw visualizations.
4. Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.

The dataset taken for the task includes the details of customers includes their marital status, their income, number of items purchased, types of items purchased, and so on.

Standardization:
Standardization is the method of feature scaling which is an integral part of feature engineering. It scales down the data and making it easier for the machine learning model to learn from it. It reduces the mean to ‘0’ and the standard deviation to ‘1’.

Segmentation:
We will be using T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. It helps in visualizing high-dimensional data. It converts similarities between data points to joint probabilities and tries to minimize the values to low-dimensional embedding.
